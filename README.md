# Models for Poetic
> This repository hosts all models for the Poetic repository/Python package.

## [Poetic](https://github.com/kevin931/poetic)
Poetic (formerly Poetic Predictor) is an open-source machine learning project that predicts how poetic language is. To find out more, please head to its official repository: https://github.com/kevin931/poetic.

## What is this for?
This repository specifically hosts models as releases for poetic to download so that large repository and packages can be avoided if possible. This method also allows users to specify which model to download and install in the future.

## How to use the models?
The Poetic package will handle the downloading of the models. No manual downloading of them needed. More information on this feature will come as the Poetic repository is being updated. For now, this repository is for **internal testing** only.
