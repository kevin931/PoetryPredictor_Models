# Models for Poetic
> This repository hosts all models for the Poetic repository/Python package.

## [Poetic](https://github.com/kevin931/poetic)
Poetic (poetic-py on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/poetic-py/) and [conda](https://anaconda.org/kevin931/poetic-py)) is an open-source machine learning project and toolkit for predicting and processing poetry. To find out more about the project, please head to its official repository: https://github.com/kevin931/poetic.

## What is this for?
This repository specifically hosts models as releases for poetic to download so that large repository and packages can be avoided if possible. This method also allows users to specify which model to download and install in the future.

## How to use the models?
The Poetic package has built-in functions to handle the download process without any need to manually download the models. For documentation and usage, please see our [full documentation](https://poetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

## Versioning

The versions and release tags of this repository do not correspond to the main repository because models are not and do not need to be frequently updated. Therefore, this does not follow
the release schedule of [poetic](https://github.com/kevin931/poetic).
